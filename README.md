# Project
This is a smart contract that represents a basic calculator

## Description
This smart contract provides a basic implementation of a calculator with an add, subtract, multiply, and divide as the common operators. Lastly, since this calculator contains some sort of "memory" which is the pastResult variable, it contains a function to clear the past results.
